# Fzfmenu Configuration File
#
# This file is used to define fzfmenu's main program settings and plugin list.
#

# --- Main Settings ---

# `terminal` (string): 
# Specifies the name or path of a terminal emulator. This program will be used
# to launch the fzfmenu interface.
# Examples: "foot", "kitty", "alacritty", "gnome-terminal", etc.
# Ensure that the terminal supports the `-e` option to run a command.
terminal = "foot"

# `arguments` (array of strings):
# Provides additional arguments to be passed to the terminal emulator.
# For example, the `-a` argument is often used to set the application's name or class.
arguments = ["-a", "fzfmenu"]

# `fzf_arguments` (array of strings):
# Provides arguments to be passed directly to the `fzf` command.
# Use this field to customize `fzf`'s appearance and behavior, such as
# its layout, border style, or colors.
# For a full list of options, see the fzf man page or documentation.
fzf_arguments = ["--border=rounded", "--layout=rounded"]

# --- Plugin Configuration ---

# `[[plugins]]` (table array):
# This is a TOML table array used to define each plugin.
# Each `[[plugins]]` block represents a separate fzfmenu plugin.

[[plugins]]
# `name` (string):
# The name of the plugin, used for display in the fzfmenu interface.
# It should be a short, easily recognizable name, like "app_launcher".

# `description` (optional string):
# A brief description of the plugin, providing extra information about its purpose.
# This can be displayed as help text in the fzfmenu interface.
description = "Launch applications based on your desktop environment."

# `prefix` (string):
# The command prefix that triggers this plugin. Users type this prefix at the fzf prompt
# to activate the plugin.
# If the prefix is an empty string (""), this plugin is considered the default.
prefix = ""

# `picker` (string):
# The command executed when the plugin is activated to generate a list of candidates.
# Fzfmenu runs this command and uses its standard output as fzf's input.
# The `{}` is a placeholder that will be replaced by the remaining text the user typed
# at the fzf prompt.
picker = "python ~/.config/fzfmenu/plugins/app_launcher.py picker {}"

# `runner` (string):
# The command executed when a user selects an item from the list.
# Fzfmenu runs this command.
